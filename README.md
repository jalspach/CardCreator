This tool grabs data from the CSV and pushes it over a default image creating a new image that staff can use as an email footer. Next steps will be to tie it to a web front end so that staff can generate their own.

Added .gitignore so that the .csv and the generated .png files are not tracked


TODO: I like the weight/color of the pronouns.
take out "Shasta County Office of Education" (that's in the logo) and add Department to "Information Technology Department," but make it the same color as the address, and maybe un-bold it.
Super picky grammar edit would be to change Avenue to Ave. and put a comma between that and the word Redding, so "Ave., Redding"
